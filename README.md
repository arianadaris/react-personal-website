# react-personal-website
This is my first version of my personal website, using React. This project helped me gain experience with React, as well as gain practice with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Additionally, this project allowed me to experiment with Figma, a prototyping tool.

Below are images of my website as of November 7, 2021

# November 7 Update
This version of my website is not the finalized version. For example, a feature I would love to implement is the ability to click on one of my personal projects on the Work page and be rerouted to a page that gives more details about the project, rather than immediately linking to my GitHub repository. Additionally, I'd like to fine tune the animation on the wave SVGs in the background of each page.
